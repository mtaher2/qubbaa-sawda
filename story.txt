One once upon a time there was a professor name Mehlhase.

On a sunny day, she was walking with her dog, Sir Barkalot, who was proudly wearing Leather Pants on the Main Street, suddenly he ran off, causing a little chaos!

Sir Barkalot dashed past the Baeckerei, around the Biergarten and into Schloss Eltz.

Professor Mehlhase hurried after Sir Barkalot, calling his name, as the townsfolk chuckled and pointed at the mischievous dog in his stylish leather pants.

she found the dog dancing to a Rammstein song, happily eating a sausage, while people dressed in dirndls celebrated joyfully inside the castle.

As they drove away, Sir Barkalot stuck his head out of the window, enjoying the breeze, while the professor dreamed of winning a wettbewerbsfaehig pastry contest with her favorite Gebaeck recipe.

The wind slowly grew into a tornado, but they couldn't roll the window up due to the lack of klimaanlage in the car.
